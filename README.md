# Earthen Invocation
A Unique spell individually designed and created for the third-person fantasy action RPG Samsara.

The spell involves kicking up a boulder of earth, splintering it, and propelling the shards towards enemies.

An enemy hit by the shards is inflicted with heavy poise damage and light physical damage. The spell is designed primarily as a crowd-control mechanism, allowing the player to have a tool for dealing with otherwise overwhelming combat situations.
